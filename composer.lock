For having a quick but working prototype of your application, simply model the database, run DataObject&amp;amp;apos;s createTable script over it and write a script that passes one of the resulting objects to the FormBuilder class. The FormBuilder will automatically generate a simple but working HTML_QuickForm object that you can use to test your application. It also provides a processing method that will automatically detect if an insert() or update() command has to be executed after the form has been submitted. If you have set up DataObject&amp;amp;apos;s links.ini file correctly, it will also automatically detect if a table field is a foreign key and will populate a selectbox with the linked table&amp;amp;apos;s entries. There are many optional parameters that you can place in your DataObjects.ini or in the properties of your derived classes, that you can use to fine-tune the form-generation, gradually turning the prototypes into fully-featured forms, and you can take control at any stage of the process."
